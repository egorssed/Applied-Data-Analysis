In order to reproduce Figure 5 (only diabetes prevalence) from the paper, you need to use two csv files, namely 'year_osward_grocery.csv' and 'diabetes_estimates_osward_2016.csv' which are available in this folder. 

'year_osward_grocery.csv' - contains the aggregated information on food purchases, enriched with information
coming from the census for the full year 2015 at ward level.

'diabetes_estimates_osward_2016.csv' - contains data about the fraction of adults among those registered at a GP practice in England who are affected by type-2 diabetes.
